	abstract = {Recent approaches have investigated assisting users in making early trade-off decisions when the future evolution of project elements is uncertain. These approaches have demonstrated promise in their analytical capabilities; yet, stakeholders have expressed concerns about the readability of the models and resulting analysis, which builds upon Tropos. Tropos is based on formal semantics enabling automated analysis; however, this creates a problem of interpreting evidence pairs. The aim of our broader research project is to improve the process of model comprehension and decision making by improving how analysts interpret and make decisions. We extend and evaluate a prior approach, called EVO, which uses color to visualize evidence pairs. In this scientific evaluation paper, we explore the effectiveness and usability of EVO. We conduct an experiment ($n=32$) to measure any effect of using colors to represent evidence pairs. We find that with minimal training, untrained modelers were able to use the color visualization for decision making. The visualization significantly improves the speed of model comprehension and users found it helpful. },

	abstract = {Automated analysis has been used in goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE) to evaluate scenarios and make trade-off decisions. For higher complexity problems (e.g., backwards analysis), using a search-based solver may be more efficient than custom algorithms. When these black-box solvers produce a single solution, users may be suspicious about whether the given answer is ideal or believable. Users would like to explore the potential solutions but are prevented from doing so because these inquiries often suffer from a state explosion problem. In this RE@Next! paper, we introduce the use of valuation-based filtering and coloring to assist users in understanding a solution space and selecting custom states from it. We use the concrete semantics of modeling requirements in the Evolving Intentions framework and its associated goal modeling tool, BloomingLeaf, to explore the application of these visualization techniques. In our initial evaluation, we demonstrate how these techniques can be used on a fully worked out example. We conduct initial measurements of the time savings and state space reduction created by the valuations and color filtering, and discuss future directions of this project.},

	abstract = {[Context and Motivation] During elicitation, in addition to collecting requirements, analysts also collect stakeholders' goals and the present and historical interests that motivate their goals. This information can guide the resolution of requirements conflicts, support the evolution of requirements when changes occur (e.g., environmental constraints), and inform decisions in software design. [Problem] Unfortunately, this information is rarely explicitly represented and maintained. When a stakeholder is modeled in the literature, the captured information is only part of that stakeholder's intention (i.e., the goals and the present and historical interests that motivate those goals) and not other requirements documents. In addition, such representations of a stakeholder are not traced and kept aligned with the design and, thus, cannot be used during iterative development and in case of changes. [Principal Idea] To support engineers in making informed decisions during the design, development, and evolution of a system, we propose a framework to collect and maintain intentionality in an efficient and effortless way. [Contributions] To define intentionality, disambiguate it from its use in literature, and position it in relation to similar concepts (i.e., rationale and goals), we conduct a literature review. Based on our derived definition, we present our framework to appropriately include intentionality throughout the stages of a project and the research agenda to realize such a framework.},

The Writing Across the Curriculum initiative endeavours to engage students in writing and creating a community that supports writing and its teaching in every discipline. As part of this initiative, computer science ({CS}) instructors at a large public university added a weekly blogging assignment to their {CSII} course with four aims: 
(1) improve student learning of writing and {CS} concepts; 
(2) understand local variations among language speakers; 
(3) provide writing feedback at scale; and 
(4) combine writing-to-learn with disciplinary writing.
In this paper, we present the design rationale for the blog assignment, as well as the results of an empirical study of how the assignment is perceived by students and teaching assistants. Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we tease apart the mixed perceptions of the students and the outcomes of our assignment aims.

Prior work proposed several studies aimed at investigating what utility stakeholders derive from constructing and analyzing goal models. We designed and conducted an initial empirical study that explores the construction stage of goal modeling, asking whether stakeholders benefit from manually drawing their model. We recruited eight qualified participants and asked each to create a goal model for a decision they were considering, while talking out loud. Half of the participants in this study used {BloomingLeaf}, while the remaining participants drew goal models by hand. Using information gathered through an online pre-study questionnaire, we constructed a goal model for each participant. Participants compared our generated models with their manually created ones. We used open coding to find themes and categories for qualitative responses. Analysis showed participants preferred their own model to the researcher generated one. The results of which have implications for future studies, as well as goal model adoption and automation.},

Specifically, we are interested in studying if coloring intentions with evaluation information allows for better comparisons of initial states and simulations of future paths. To address this question, we developed a color visualization extension to {BloomingLeaf}, a goal model analysis tool, where the color of each node is changed based on either the initial evaluations or the resulting analysis over time. This then allows us to explore if and how color visualization assists the user with decision making. We present our implementation and initial evaluation of this extension.},

	abstract = {Goal models help stakeholders make trade-off decisions in the early stages of project development. While these approaches have significant analysis capabilities, they have yet to see broad industrial adoption, with the construction of scalable large realistic goal models acting as a significant barrier. Over the last decade, researchers have used force-directed algorithms, specifically {GraphViz}, to layout goal models and have called for improved layout algorithms to better accommodate the unique challenges presented by actor-based models. We extend a force directed algorithm to include goal model heuristics, and independently arrived at a domain specific version of a generic layout algorithm for undirected compound graphs. As initial validation of the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm, we implement our approach in {BloomingLeaf}, a goal model analysis tool. Initial results are promising; yet, further collaboration and validation across the various goal modeling approaches (e.g., {GRL}, {iStar}, Tropos) is required before we can recommend our approach to be adopted in tooling.

More recently, we extended this analysis to allow users to explore states along the path and generate their own simulation paths. However, this approach is limited by users ability to comprehend the state space, which grows exponentially with the size of the model. In this paper, we explore using filters to reduce the number of viewable solutions enabling users to create their own simulation results.

If the fundamental purpose of goal models is to allow stakeholders to generate scenarios and ask what if questions, then which parts of the process of model construction, analysis, and evolution benefit from and which are hindered by manual activities? The recent expansion of goal modelling to ask time-based questions further amplifies this issue because significant additional information is required from stakeholders. Through a series of empirical studies, we aim to isolate the processes of model construction, analysis, and evolution for the purpose of studying the utility of goal-oriented requirements engineering approaches and exploring which tasks are essential practices that stakeholders must complete themselves to gain modeling benefit, and which tasks can be simplified through automation. In this process, we will also measure the benefits of completing relevant goal modelling activities with and without timing analysis.
