	title = {A Preliminary Investigation of the Utility of Goal Model Construction},
	abstract = {Goal models have long been used in the literature to model and reason about stakeholders' intentions. Prior work proposed several studies aimed at investigating what utility stakeholders derive from constructing and analyzing goal models. We designed and conducted an initial empirical study that explores the construction stage of goal modeling, asking whether stakeholders benefit from manually drawing their model. We recruited eight qualified participants and asked each to create a goal model for a decision they were considering, while talking out loud. Half of the participants in this study used {BloomingLeaf}, while the remaining participants drew goal models by hand. Using information gathered through an online pre-study questionnaire, we constructed a goal model for each participant. Participants compared our generated models with their manually created ones. We used open coding to find themes and categories for qualitative responses. Analysis showed participants preferred their own model to the researcher generated one. The results of which have implications for future studies, as well as goal model adoption and automation.},

	title = {Towards an Evaluation Visualization with Color},
	abstract = {Goal models help stakeholders understand project scenarios and make decisions. In prior work, we used Tropos evaluation semantics to allow for automated analysis over time; however, formal evaluation labels (e.g., (F, bottom)) are difficult for users to interpret across a large model. In this paper, we present our work towards understanding the extent to which using colors in goal modeling affects users' ability to make decisions. Specifically, we are interested in studying if coloring intentions with evaluation information allows for better comparisons of initial states and simulations of future paths. To address this question, we developed a color visualization extension to {BloomingLeaf}, a goal model analysis tool, where the color of each node is changed based on either the initial evaluations or the resulting analysis over time. This then allows us to explore if and how color visualization assists the user with decision making. We present our implementation and initial evaluation of this extension.},

	title = {Towards a General Solution for Layout of Visual Goal Models with Actors},
	abstract = {Goal models help stakeholders make trade-off decisions in the early stages of project development. While these approaches have significant analysis capabilities, they have yet to see broad industrial adoption, with the construction of scalable large realistic goal models acting as a significant barrier. Over the last decade, researchers have used force-directed algorithms, specifically {GraphViz}, to layout goal models and have called for improved layout algorithms to better accommodate the unique challenges presented by actor-based models. We extend a forcedirected algorithm to include goal model heuristics, and independently arrived at a domain specific version of a generic layout algorithm for undirected compound graphs. As initial validation of the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm, we implement our approach in {AnonymousTool}, a goal model analysis tool. Initial results are promising; yet, further collaboration andvalidation across the various goal modeling approaches (e.g., {GRL}, {iStar}, Tropos) is  equired before we can recommend ourapproach to be adopted in tooling. This paper presents early results and lays a foundation for discussion within our {GORE} community},
