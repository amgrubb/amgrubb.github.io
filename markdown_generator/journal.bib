	abstract = {In order to build resilient systems that can be operational for a long time, it is important that analysts are able to model the evolution of the requirements of that system. The Evolving Intentions framework models how stakeholders' goals change over time. In this work, our aim is to validate applicability and effectiveness of this technique on a substantial case. In the absence of ground truth about future evolutions, we used historical data and rational reconstruction to understand how a project evolved in the past. Seeking a well-documented project with varying stakeholder intentions over a substantial period of time, we selected requirements of the Toronto Spadina Expressway. In this paper, we report on the experience and the results of modeling this project over different time periods, which enabled us to assess the modeling and reasoning capabilities of the approach, its support for asking and answering `what if' questions, and the maturity of the underlying tool support. We also demonstrate a novel process for creating time-based models through the construction and merging of scenarios.},

@article{grubb_formal_2021,
	abstract = {In early-phase requirements engineering, modeling stakeholder goals and intentions helps stakeholders understand the problem context and evaluate tradeoffs, by exploring possible "what if" questions.  Prior research allows modelers to make evaluation assignments to desired goals and generate possible selections for task and dependency alternatives, but this treats models as static snapshots, where the evaluation of the fulfillment of an intention remains constant once it has been determined.  Using these techniques stakeholders are unable to reason about possible evolutions, leaving questions about project viability unanswered when the fulfillment of goals or availability of components is not guaranteed in the future. In this article, we formalize the Evolving Intentions framework for specifying, modeling, and reasoning about goals that change over time. Using the Tropos language, we specify a set of functions that define how intentions and relationships evolve, and use path-based analysis for asking a variety of "what if" questions about such changes. We illustrate the framework using the Bike Lanes example and prove correctness of the analysis. Finally, we demonstrate scalability and effectiveness, enabling stakeholders to explore model evolution.},

@article{dhaouadi_towards_2021,
	abstract = {Modelers encounter different kinds of uncertainty in their designs and models of software systems. One such type concerns uncertainty about how to build a model. This is called design-time uncertainty, and existing research has studied how modelers can work in its presence. However, the process by which they come to elicit and express their uncertainties remains unclear. In this paper, we take steps towards addressing this gap by introducing DRUIDE (Design and Requirements Uncertainty Integrated Development Environment), a language and workflow for articulating design time uncertainty. We present and illustrate our proposal on a software design example.  Additionally, we conduct a real life case study of domain analysis related to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluate DRUIDE with it.  Our evaluation shows that DRUIDE is sufficiently expressive to articulate design time uncertainty.},

	title = {{A Systematic Literature Review of Requirements Engineering Education}},
	abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) has established itself as a core software engineering discipline. It is well acknowledged that good RE leads to higher quality software and considerably reduces the risk of failure or budget-overspending of software development projects. It is of vital importance to train future software engineers in RE and educate future requirements engineers to adequately manage requirements in various projects. To this date, there exists no central concept of what RE education shall comprise. To lay a foundation, we report on a systematic literature review of the field and provide a systematic map describing the current state of RE education. Doing so allows us to describe how the educational landscape has changed over the last decade. Results show that only a few established author collaborations exist and that RE education research is predominantly published in venues other than the top RE research venues (i.e., in venues other than the RE conference and journal). Key trends in RE instruction of the past decade include involvement of real or realistic stakeholders, teaching predominantly elicitation as an RE activity, and increasing student factors such as motivation or communication skills. Finally, we discuss open opportunities in RE education, such as training for security requirements and supply chain risk management, as well as developing a pedagogical foundation grounded in evidence of effective instructional approaches.},

  abstract 	   = {Recent approaches have investigated assisting users in making early trade-off decisions when the future evolution of project elements is uncertain. These approaches have demonstrated promise in their analytical capabilities; yet, stakeholders have expressed concerns about the readability of the models and resulting analysis, which builds upon Tropos. Tropos is based on formal semantics enabling automated analysis; however, this creates a problem of interpreting evidence pairs. The aim of our broader research project is to improve the process of model comprehension and decision-making by improving how analysts interpret and make decisions. We extend and evaluate a prior approach, called EVO, which uses color to visualize evidence pairs. In this article, we explore the effectiveness of EVO with and without the impacts of tooling through a two-phased empirical study. All subjects in both phases were untrained modelers, given training at study time. First, we conduct an experiment to measure any effect of using colors to represent evidence pairs. Second, we explore how subjects engage in decision-making activities (with or without color) through a user study. We find that the EVO color visualization significantly improves the speed of model comprehension and is perceived as helpful by study subjects.},
