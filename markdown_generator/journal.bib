@article{grubb_formal_2021,
	abstract = {In early-phase requirements engineering, modeling stakeholder goals and intentions helps stakeholders understand the problem context and evaluate tradeoffs, by exploring possible ``what if'' questions.  Prior research allows modelers to make evaluation assignments to desired goals and generate possible selections for task and dependency alternatives, but this treats models as static snapshots, where the evaluation of the fulfillment of an intention remains constant once it has been determined.  Using these techniques stakeholders are unable to reason about possible evolutions, leaving questions about project viability unanswered when the fulfillment of goals or availability of components is not guaranteed in the future. In this article, we formalize the Evolving Intentions framework for specifying, modeling, and reasoning about goals that change over time. Using the Tropos language, we specify a set of functions that define how intentions and relationships evolve, and use path-based analysis for asking a variety of ``what if'' questions about such changes. We illustrate the framework using the Bike Lanes example and prove correctness of the analysis. Finally, we demonstrate scalability and effectiveness, enabling stakeholders to explore model evolution.},

@article{grubb_reconstructing_2020,
	abstract = {In order to build resilient systems that can be operational for a long time, it is important that analysts are able to model the evolution of the requirements of that system. The Evolving Intentions framework models how stakeholders' goals change over time. In this work, our aim is to validate applicability and effectiveness of this technique on a substantial case. In the absence of ground truth about future evolutions, we used historical data and rational reconstruction to understand how a project evolved in the past. Seeking a well-documented project with varying stakeholder intentions over a substantial period of time, we selected requirements of the Toronto Spadina Expressway. In this paper, we report on the experience and the results of modeling this project over different time periods, which enabled us to assess the modeling and reasoning capabilities of the approach, its support for asking and answering `what if' questions, and the maturity of the underlying tool support. We also demonstrate a novel process for creating time-based models through the construction and merging of scenarios.},
