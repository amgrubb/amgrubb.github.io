A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached)
by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll
Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael

# Grubb Lab Information
This is information on how to update the website. In general to make changes,
add this repo to your GitHub Desktop, edit the files, then commit and push to
the master branch. Changes take a few minutes to update, so if nothing seems to
be changed give it a minute. There is also an option to test locally, but I have
never used it, and instead just flag in progress pages with "Page Under
Construction (Todays Date)". 

## How to update GrubbLab
This is the simplest page to update, it is simply a markdown file in the _pages
folder. Images are stored in the images folder, and referenced using HTML. The
trickiest part is the format of bios and images, which are laid out using HTML
`<divs>` but should be evident based on the existing format. 

## How to update publications
**Do not open these .bib files in BibDesk. It changes the tags to be upper case,
which breaks pubsFromBib.py.** 
The publications page is made up of several files. Firstly, publications.md in
_pages that controls the main/landing page with the list of publications with
links. Then there is pubsFromBib.py in markdown_generator which generates the
pages for the individual posts from book.bib, journal.bib, and pubs.bib. 
Finally, there is the _publications folder that
contains markdown files for each publication. 

The individual markdown files are generated when pubsFromBib.py is run (I just
use IDLE but any python IDE should work fine). This is a little tricky to run
the first time, as there are a few dependencies but after is very simple. To run
pubsFromBib.py up we need pybtex, which can be installed from
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Pip comes installed with any
of the recent python updates, I had to [set the PATH in myenvironment
variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23708898/pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)
in order to make it work. Once your pip is working, you can simply enter `pip
install pybtex` into your terminal to install [pybtex](https://pybtex.org/). On
OSX, you may need to run `python -m pip install pybtex` instead.

Once pubsFromBib.py runs without error, any time you run it, it will
automatically update every file in _publications based on the information in the
.bib files, and create files for any publication without one. To update the
information in the markdown pages, you must first update the .bib files from
markdown_generator. To do this, I simply open them in Zoterro, edit them, then
save them back into markdown_generator with the same names and overwrite the old
versions(make sure to save the notes also!). There are some subtle - but
important - distinctions between pubs.bib, journal.bib and book.bib, and they
are made based on how pubsFromBib.py reads the venuekey. It is a little bit of a
pain, and probably could/should be improved, but for now, any journals go in
journal.bib, Alicia's PHD Thesis goes in book.bib and everything else
(conference and workshop papers) go in pubs.bib to prevent any errors. Links to
the Author PrePrint, Supplemental Information, and Talk Slides are written in
markdown in a "note" in Zoterro, and when the markdown page is built by
pubsFromBib.py it is included simply as markdown and can be read into the page.
Some links are already hosted on [Dr. Grubb's Toronto
site](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amgrubb/), but local PDF's are in the files
folder.

Once pubsFromBib.py is run, all the pages are generated and there is nothing
more needed! If you wish to add additional information it is important to do it
in the appropriate .bib file, or else that information is overwritten each time
pubsFromBib.py is run. 

### Unknown Symbols
Make sure that there are no unknown symbols (diamond with question mark) in any
files or the website will not build. These will be automatically generated when
pubsFromBib.py is run, but should be replaced with daggers (†) prior to
committing the changes.

## How to update Projects
Projects is based on the "blog post" framework from Academic Pages, and is
fairly similar to Publications, except content is not automatically generated.
The projects.html file in the _pages folder controls the layout on the main
page, then _posts has the markdown files with the text of each individual post.
Because the projects page is based on a blog post format, you MUST include a
full date in YYYY-MM-DD format, though it is not published anywhere. To make a
new post, simply duplicate an old one, and rename it, ensuring that the
`permalink` matches the name of the file. 

## Notes on layout
Due to some changes to the excerpts displayed on the main pages of projects and
publication as well as making projects less like a blog, the code for the
layouts is a little funky. The main pages for projects and publications use
archive-project.html (found under _includes), and about and individual projects
(posts) and publications use archive.html(in _layouts). There was an issue where
the footer had no format and was in a weird place, so archive.html fixes this by
forcing it in, which isn't the cleanest. Archive-project.html was created to
distinguish between publications and projects, but eventually was used for both.
When simply adding information, the layouts shouldn't be an issue but I wanted
to include a bit of information which hopefully will make it easier if they ever
do need to be changed.


# Original Information from Academic Pages Author
I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel
free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic
template / theme.

### Note: if you are using this repo and now get a notification about a security vulnerability, delete the Gemfile.lock file. 

# Instructions

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail
   (required!)
1. Fork [this
   repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by
   clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with
   "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub
   username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also
   see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were
   changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a
   user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They
   will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages"
   section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the
   `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and
   talks from a TSV file.

## To run locally (not on GitHub Pages, to serve on your own computer)

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed: `sudo apt install
   ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs`
1. Run `bundle clean` to clean up the directory (no need to run `--force`)
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete
   Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll liveserve` to generate the HTML and serve it from
   `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the
   pages on change.

# Changelog -- bugfixes and enhancements

There is one logistical issue with a ready-to-fork template theme like academic
pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core
theme. If you fork this repository, customize it, then pull again, you'll
probably get merge conflicts. If you want to save your various .yml
configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork
it again. Or you can manually patch. 

To support this, all changes to the underlying code appear as a closed issue
with the tag 'code change' -- get the list
[here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22code%20change%22%20).
Each issue thread includes a comment linking to the single commit or a diff
across multiple commits, so those with forked repositories can easily identify
what they need to patch.
