<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Introduction and Purpose of Study</strong></div>

<ul>
 <li style="text-align: left;">Goal modeling is used to facilitate stakeholders evaluating potential scenarios and making decisions for projects. A goal modeling language provides users with visualizations of related tasks and resources that contribute to high-level objectives and goals.</li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">You are being asked to be in a research study investigating the utility of different methods of goal-modeling. We are examining the process of building goal models and the challenges and benefits offered by various methods of model construction and analysis. At this time, you are being asked to complete an online questionnaire. You will have the option of providing your contact information for a future follow-up study.</li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">You were selected as a possible participant for this study because you meet our inclusion criteria:
 <ul>
  <li style="text-align: left;">applied to participate in the study,&nbsp;</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">have proficiency in English,</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">be currently enrolled at Smith College,</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">be known to NOT have a color vision deficiency (i.e., you are NOT color blind), and</li>
  <li style="text-align: left;">passed CSC 223 in the fall of 2021 or are currently enrolled in CSC223 (where you have been trained in creating goal models in i*/iStar).&nbsp;</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">We ask that you read this form and ask any questions that you may have before agreeing to be in the study.&nbsp;</li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">Ultimately, this research will be submitted to Requirements Engineering publication venues.</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Description of the Study Procedures</strong></div>

<ul>
 <li style="text-align: left;">If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to complete an online questionnaire. It is expected that you can complete the questionnaire in under 60 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">The questionnaire will review basic information about the Tropos goal modeling language and ask you questions about three scenarios. We will consider the correctness of some of your responses and the insights you provide in others. The purpose of this study is to explore the utility of each approach and not individual answers. If you choose to participate, you should complete the information at the end of this consent letter.</li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">Upon collection, your data will be stored in Smith College’s Qualtrics server until the data is anonymized and coded for analysis. After that all electronic data will be stored securely on a Smith College server. Upon publication, anonymized data will be archived in a repository on Smith ScholarWorks (https://scholarworks.smith.edu). All raw information will be destroyed after 7 years.</li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">If you would like to participate and require materials to be presented in an alternative format (e.g., large font), please contact Alicia M. Grubb at amgrubb@smith.edu.</li>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Right to Refuse or Withdraw</strong></div>

<ul>
 <li style="text-align: left;">The decision to participate in this study is entirely up to you. &nbsp;You may refuse to take part in the study at any time without affecting your relationship with the investigators of this study or Smith College. &nbsp;Your decision to refuse will not result in any loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the right not to answer any single question, as well as to withdraw completely from the study at any point during the process; additionally, you have the right to request that the researcher not use any of your study material, <strong>prior to completing the survey</strong>. Participants who withdraw prior to completion will not receive compensation.</li></ul><div style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Right to Ask Questions and Report Concerns</strong></div>

<ul>
 <li style="text-align: left;">You have the right to ask questions about this research study and to have those questions answered by me before, during or after the research. &nbsp;If you have any further questions about the study, at any time feel free to contact Prof. Alicia M. Grubb at amgrubb@smith.edu. &nbsp;If you like, a summary of the results of the study will be sent to you. If you have any other concerns about your rights as a research participant that have not been answered by the investigators, you may contact the Smith College Institutional Review Board at irb@smith.edu or (413) 585-3562.</li>
 <li style="text-align: left;">If you have any problems or concerns that occur as a result of your participation, you can report them to the IRB using the contact information above. Alternatively, concerns can be reported by completing a Participant Complaint Form, which can be found on the IRB website at https://www.smith.edu/academics/institutional-review-board/compliance</li>
