The Grubb lab is the software engineering lab in the Department of <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="smith.edu/">Smith College</a>. Our work
focuses on goal modeling, and how stakeholders can effectively use models in
collaboration. Goal models are a collection of nodes and links that represent
the intentions of stakeholders and tradeoffs within the system under
consideration. They can be used to make decisions in early-phase requirements
engineering as well as in other contexts. The following image is an example of a
goal model created in our tool BloomingLeaf, a browser-based tool developed by
the lab. See below to join us.

## How to Join

We are seeking new lab members interested in both software development and
requirements research. There are different ways to conduct research in the Grubb
Lab (e.g., volunteer, special studies, SURF, STRIDE, AEMES, or a senior honors thesis
project). Those interested in development or software engineering research
should have completed or be currently enrolled in CSC210. Ideally, students
interested in pursuing a Senior Honors Thesis should contact Alicia in their
junior year. Interested? Contact [Alicia](amgrubb@smith.edu). Not sure what to
say? Review the “Recommendations for Emailing Professors” [on the Research at
Smith page](https://www.smith.edu/academics/research-at-smith). Want to know
what it’s like? Reach out to one of our current or past members.

<!-- ## SURF 2024

Each summer the Grubb lab accepts 5-8 students interested in software development and/or empirical research (i.e., software engineering).  

We are developing a framework to integrate requirements techniques with development activities (e.g., coding, testing). By linking requirements with the documentation of development activities, we hope to make it easier for programmers to engage with the requirements for their project. We are investigating how to model artifacts in a GitLab repository. Our initial proof-of-concept was [designed by past SURF students](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2022-08-03-gitre) in the lab. In summer 2024, we will continue to investigate using natural language processing and artificial intelligence techniques to create traceability links between requirement and development artifacts. We will extend GitLab with these links and create new user interfaces to explore these techniques.   

We are finalizing our goal modeling tool, called [BloomingLeaf](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amgrubb/dev/blooming/). In prior development projects, we [refactored our code base](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2021-04-01-restructuring) to enable new model management features, [restructured the code base](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2021-08-13-backbone-refactor) to take advantage of underlying libraries, added [model merging](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2023-07-07-merge-interface) and automatic layout, and added [presence conditions](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2023-07-07-presence-interface). This summer we will improve and finalize our user-centered methodology and its implementation in BloomingLeaf.   

For both projects, the Grubb lab welcomes the insights of enthusiastic students interested in research, who have excellent communication skills (written/verbal English), strong programming skills, and an ability to work independently and collaboratively. Our [online codebase](https://github.com/amgrubb/BloomingLeaf) will help you create a portfolio for future applications to employers and graduate schools.

<!-- Each summer I accept 5-8 students interested in software development and/or empirical research (i.e., Software Engineering). 
For summer 2023, I will be accepting 2-4 new students. 
Please email amgrubb@smith.edu with your resume, _unofficial_ transcript, and a writing sample to apply. 

We usually have at least one development project ongoing using our tool [BloomingLeaf](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amgrubb/dev/blooming/) and this summer is no exception. We seek the help of enthusiastic students with strong programming skills and an exposure to web development (javaScript), who have excellent communication skills (written/verbal English) and an ability to work independently and collaboratively. Our [online codebase](https://github.com/amgrubb/BloomingLeaf) will help you create a portfolio for future applications to employers and graduate schools. In prior development projects, we worked on [refactoring our code base](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2021-04-01-restructuring) to enable new model management features and [restructured the code base](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2021-08-13-backbone-refactor) to take advantage of underlying libraries. Our next step is to continue to implement new visualizations and a goal modeling workflow.

For those more interested in empirical software engineering research, we are currently working on evaluating the usability of some of the algorithms we've developed over the past two years. Past SURF research projects include [studying goal model construction](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2019-09-01-goal-model-construction-study) and [evaluating a framework for uncertainty](https://amgrubb.github.io/posts/2020-08-20-covid-uncertainties).
Additionally, we are investigating how to model artifacts in a GitHub repository. These are evolving projects and we welcome the insights of enthusiastic students interested in research, who have excellent communication skills (written/verbal English) and an ability to work independently and collaboratively. 
Students with an interest in research and/or an interest in quantitative (e.g., spreadsheets, r, statistics) or qualitative (e.g., open coding, ethnography) data analysis should state this on their application.
