The Grubb lab is the software engineering lab in the Department of [Computer Science](http://cs.smith.edu/) at [Smith College](www.smith.edu). 
Our work focuses on goal modeling, and how stakeholders can effectively use models in collaboration. 
Goal models are a collection of nodes and links that represent the intentions of stakeholders and tradeoffs within the system under consideration. 
They can be used to make decisions in early-phase requirements engineering as well as in other contexts. 
The following image is an example of a goal model created in our tool BloomingLeaf, a browser-based tool developed by the lab. 
See below to join us.

## How to Join

We are seeking new lab members interested in both software development and requirements research. There are different ways to conduct research in the Grubb Lab (e.g., volunteer, special studies, SURF, STRIDE, or a Senior Honors Thesis project).
Those interested in development or software engineering research should have completed or be currently enrolled in CSC212. Ideally, students interested in pursuing a Senior Honors Thesis should contact Alicia in their junior year.
Interested? Contact [Alicia](amgrubb@smith.edu). Not sure what to say? Review the “Recommendations for Emailing Professors” [on the Research at Smith page](https://www.smith.edu/academics/research-at-smith). Want to know what it’s like? Reach out to one of our current or past members.
