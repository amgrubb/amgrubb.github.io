**Page under construction! 7/21/2020**

The Grubb lab is a software engineering lab in the [Computer Science](http://cs.smith.edu/) department of [Smith College](www.smith.edu). Our work focuses on goal modeling, and how users can effectively use models in collaboration. Goal modeling is a system of nodes and links that can be used to make decisions in early phase software engineering as well as in other contexts, as seen below. Our work is done in BloomingLeaf, a web tool developed by the lab.
