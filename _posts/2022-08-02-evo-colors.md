**All the International Color Palettes You Could’ve I-magenta-ed**  
**_Catherine Kung, Sonora Halili, Yanning Tan, Cyrine Ben Ayed_**

Evolution over time is a key feature of goal models. It is important for users to be able to quickly comprehend these changes over time. The Evaluation Visualization Overlay (EVO) tool in BloomingLeaf allows users to see the evolution of their goals’ satisfaction values over time through the use of colors. 

The existing color palette that BloomingLeaf used presented most satisfied goals with blue, and least satisfied ones with red. Partially satisfied and none values varied between purple and shades of gray. However, we concluded that this palette could be confusing and misleading to international audiences, given different interpretations and connotations of certain colors, so we implemented an additional three palettes to make goal models more readable to these audiences. We also added a feature that allows the user to input their own color preferences for each satisfaction value, thus creating a personalized palette that works best for their color interpretations.
