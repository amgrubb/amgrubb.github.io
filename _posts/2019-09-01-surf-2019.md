Towards Merging Models over Different Time Intervals
===

BloomingLeaf is an analysis and modeling tool that allows stakeholders to model goals and intentions. The tool helps users understand model evolution and tradeoffs by evaluating how intentions change over time. Prior work looked at creating models piecemeal, by constructing models of individual actors over different time periods and then merging them together. Grubb proposed an algorithm for merging goal models and showed a potential application; but, did not implement the proposed semi-automated algorithm. In this project, we explored the problem domain of this merge algorithm and developed underlying tooling.

To fully implement the algorithm, we needed to merge both the visual syntax and underlying semantics of both un-timed and evolving goal models. We worked on the merging of timed functions. In this project, all functions are step-wise atomic functions over disjoint neighboring intervals, where the atomic functions are constant, increase, decrease, and stochastic. Consider the functions in Figure 1, Model A is an increasing function over the interval [tA1, tA2) and Model B is a constant function over the interval [tB1, tB2). The purpose of our algorithm is to specify Model AB.

Specifying the resulting Model AB depends on the underlying timeline over which each model is defined. For example, in Figure 1, if tA2 < tB1 then there exists an unspecified gap in the function. If tA2 > tB1 then there exists an overlap in the function which may result in a conflict.
Finally, if tA2 = tB1 then the two functions align. In Figure 1, Model AB assumes the case where tA2 = tB1 with the new interval [tA1, tB2). We focused on the tA2 = tB1 case in this research project.

With this timeline, we investigated how the two functions should be merged. We found that Model A and Model B can be merged into either an increase function followed by a constant function, or an increase function with a single time point specified. We proved (by contradiction) the soundness of our assertion. We implemented the first case of the merge algorithm (tA2 = tB1). Future work will finish the implementation for the two other cases and create a web interface for the merge algorithm.

A Preliminary Study of the Utility of Goal Model Construction
===

Goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE) is a subset of requirements engineering, which focuses on the elicitation and analysis of stakeholders' intentions \[1\]. Grubb proposed several studies aimed at investigating what utility stakeholders derive from constructing and analyzing goal models \[2\]. In this project, we designed and conducted an empirical study that explored the construction stage of goal modeling, asking whether stakeholders benefit from manually drawing their model (on paper or in a tool) for the purpose of understanding and generating project scenarios. Specifically, we compared reviewing auto-generated models with manually created ones for the purpose of helping students answer their own self-directed questions, the results of which have implications for goal model adoption and automation.

In order to compare subjects’ self-created models with auto-generated models, we asked subjects to discuss a decision they were considering through an online pre-study questionnaire. We manually constructed a goal model from the pre-study. In a one-hour in-person session, participants first answered questions about a training video to measure their understanding. Participants then constructed a model of their decision while talking out loud. Half of the participants in this study used BloomingLeaf (a web-based goal modeling tool), while the remaining participants drew goal models by hand. We prompted participants with a list of prepared questions to help them add new elements and links. After the participants finished their model, we asked them to compare their model to the one we created from their pre-study questionnaire. We then asked them to extend their preferred model with new insights generated. Finally, we asked participants questions to explicate what utility (if any) they experienced in making their decision.

We recruited eight qualified participants at Smith College in the summer of 2019. Each participant was randomly assigned to either the Paper group or the Tool group. They completed an in-person training session and were asked to construct a goal model either on paper or with Bloomingleaf. We used open coding to find themes and categories for qualitative responses. Early analysis showed participants preferred their own model to the researcher generated one. The analysis is ongoing, and we hope to present results later this year.
