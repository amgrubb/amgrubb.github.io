Abstract: Goal models for early phase requirements enable modelers to elicit stakeholders' intentions, analyze dependencies and select preferred alternatives. Standard analysis techniques provide options for analysis of static goal models but do not consider the dynamic environment that the model represents and do not evaluate the intentions over time. In this position paper, we illustrate that goal model analysis for early phase requirements can be improved by explicitly considering the intention dynamics of a potential system across multiple time scales.
