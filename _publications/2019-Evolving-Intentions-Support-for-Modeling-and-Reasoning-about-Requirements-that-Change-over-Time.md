In early-phase software engineering, stakeholders organize and define system requirements, constraints within the domain and environment, and stakeholders' intentions (i.e., goals, tasks, resources, and soft-goals/qualities). Modeling stakeholder goals and intentions helps stakeholders understand the problem context and evaluate tradeoffs, by exploring possible "what if'' questions. Using these techniques, stakeholders are unable to reason about possible evolutions of scenarios, leaving questions unanswered about project viability when the fulfillment of goals or availability of components is not guaranteed in the future. This project focuses on specifying, modeling, and reasoning about goals that change over time (relative or absolute). Using simulation and SAT-based analysis, we created and validated a methodology for asking and answering questions about the evolution of qualitative goal models.
