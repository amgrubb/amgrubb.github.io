Abstract: Goal modeling enables the elicitation of stakeholders' intentionality in the earlier stages of a project. Often, approaches are limited by the effort required to create an initial goal model. In this paper, we investigate the problem of model merging for Tropos goal models. Specifically, we propose a formal approach to the problem of automatically merging the attributes of intentions and actors, once these elements have been matched. Additionally, recent approaches have investigated answering questions about future evolutions of stakeholders' projects with goal models. In this work we consider both static models, as well as those with timing information, using the principles of gullibility, contradiction, and consensus. We study our implementation and validate the merge operation on a variety of models from the literature.
